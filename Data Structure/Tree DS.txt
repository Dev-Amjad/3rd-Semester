1)Binary Tree
-A Tree with each node having at most 2 children is called binary tree.

	Types of binary tree:
		i) Full/Strict Binary tree
			:- Type of binary tree in which every node has 0 or 2 Children

		ii) Almost Complete Binary
			:- In this type of binary tree we assign value from left to right child
			   and have to complete a level first.

		iii) Complete/Perfect Binary tree
			:- In this type of tree every node has 2 childs except leaf nodes, means no holes,
				Note:-Last level is the highest level in between all should be filled.

		iv) Binary Search tree
			:-It is a Type of binary tree which follows the pattern of:
				leftNode(item) < Node(item) < rightNode(item)

	Height=biggest level;
	...Level=eneration...

	i)Maximum Numbers of nodes at level i(0-n) is {2^i};
	ii)Maximum Numbers of nodes in a tree with height h is {(2^h)-1};

  		Implementation:
			1)Array

				i)left child of i=2*i;
				ii)right child of i=2*i+1;
				iii) Parent node of any node i =i/2;
